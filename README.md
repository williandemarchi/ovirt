oVirtSimpleBackup - WebGUI (0.6.32)
A REST API backup from PHP for oVirt 4.2.x
NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE * NOTE
I no longer use oVirt, so I wont be furthering this project. oVirt is >>Awesome<< however, I decided to move all of my VMs into a large managed datacentre that uses vmware.

I want to thank the oVirt community and all of the people over on IRC for thier awesome support.

Feel free to use this code for your own ovirt backups or future oVirt backup software.
